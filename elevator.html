<p>Where did you learn how to use a computer to do awesome things? If you're anything like me, you spent far too
much time lurking sketchy forums, scrolling Twitter, hanging out in IRCs, and generally going about things all the wrong way, with nothing but bad influences.
</p>
<p>
I got lucky, and you did too. But for each success story of the self-taught "hacker" there are thousands of people who left infosec because
they never got the support they needed to learn the right way, and there are more than a few cautionary tales of kids who left
high school with a record.
</p>
<p>
I'm building this site to help guide and support the next generation by providing a place to learn through training, competition,
and most importantly community.
Nobody should have to go it alone, and we have the resources and the mentors needed to do this.

 Making the internet a better place for people to learn how to succeed in infosec means a lot to me, and I know it does to you...
    </br>
 after all, we're all alike.
