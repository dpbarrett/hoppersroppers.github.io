* Once you tell people that you are doing this, they will start asking questions. You should have answers.   
      
* Hacker FAQ
  
   * Can you hack my FB/Email/bank account/whatever?
      * Yes
      * Phishing email to keylogger payload.
      * It doesn't count as "hacking" if you steal someone's phone or they forget to log off their computer. Nothing cool about that.
   * Can you hack my girlfriend's FB/Email/Whatever?
      * Probably, but it's super illegal. See ____ of the CFAA. Also, don't be weird.
   * Have you been to the darkweb?
      * Once you finish this course, you will have been on the spoooky "dark web". For now, just say no because there isn't anything there except drugs and child porn. 
   * I think I have malware, can you fix it?
      * Yes. Download malwarebytes. 
   * Can you hack my phone?
      * Is it an iPhone? 
         * Yes. 
	    * No. Say what you will about Apple, but they make a secure phone. There's a reason ios exploits sell for millions of dollars while Android ones only cost a few dozen grand.
         * No. 
	    * So Android? Yeah, probably. Android's have notoriously poor security and patching mechanisms.
   * My computer is broken, fix it
