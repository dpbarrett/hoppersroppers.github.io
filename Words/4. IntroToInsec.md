What, you thought we were too cool for plebe cyber? Absolutely not, parts of that course are some of the best written material on the subject. And the DoD is the best in the world at managing risk.

Write a few sentences on the difference between Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk.

Write a few sentences on what makes the risk management tradeoff difficult.

What is the risk equation? 

Describe the risk management process

What are the four principles of ORM?

What are the three levels of ORM?


So now that you know what a threat is, here is a quick paper on threats. It will contain things you don't know. As you read through it, look them up. 

Read this: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1401_08-12_mickens.pdf
Submit what the benefit is of making you look up all the words you don't know.

Submit the main takeaway you had from this paper.

	 * You probably don't know much right now technically, but technical knowledge is meant to inform your decision making processes, and you can usually get along fairly well on common sense and procedure. 

Submit a risk assessment for your usna.edu email account following the NIST risk assessment process.

1. Identify Risks

2. Analyze the Risks

3. Prioritize the Risks

4. Address the Risks

5. Monitor the Risks


 Don't worry about feeling like you don't have much content, we are going to look at this problem again once you have more knowledge and you will approach it very differently.

         * Killchain
So how has security adapted to face all these threats? Basically, the most modern idea is the idea of defense in depth, making it so the bad guys have to beat layer after layer of security in order to get in, and then back out. The go-to model is the cyber killchain by Lockheed Martin, and while it gets a ton of crap, it is honestly a very good way of looking at it.

Read this: www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf

Make sure you know the different layers of the killchain. 

Recon
Weaponization
Delivery
Exploitation
Installation
Command and Control
Actions on Objectives
One of the most common arguments against the killchain is that "Actions on Objectives" is too vague. For one, all of the other steps of the killchain can occur as an action on objective if the attacker uses it to attack something else, which is known as pivoting. But there are many other "post-exploitation" objectives of an attacker, which range from installing backdoors to bricking the device. 

There are 5 P's of Post-Exploitation:

Persistence = Find a way to maintain access 
Privilege Escalation = Find a way to get a higher level of access than you already have
Pilfer = Steal things
Pillage = Break things. 
Pivot = Move from one box to another and start the killchain all over again.
I will write a good post on this at some point, but for now, just try to remember what each of those things means. 



Tasks: 

Describe a hypothetical attack on a user via email, using your current understanding, from recon all the way through all the post exploitation possibilities. It is fine if you don't have the technical understanding, we are just trying to make sure you have the concepts down. You are going to look back at this scenario later in the course and do it again, once you have more technical concepts down.

            * Domains of Attack
	    There are a lot of ways for you to get hacked, so there is no way we can go over them all. 

But, we can go over good ways to think about this. 

First, we can think about in terms of attack mechanisms as seen here. This is a crazy useful resource that will require its own section someday.

Collect and Analyze Information 
Inject Unexpected Items 
Engage in Deceptive Interactions 
Manipulate Timing and State
Abuse Existing Functionality
Employ Probabilistic Techniques 
Subvert Access Control 
Manipulate Data Structures 
Manipulate System Resources 
Task: 

For each attack mechanism, describe in two sentences what the thing being attacked is and how they generally work. This is going to take some research, but shouldn't take all that long. You can click to expand to learn more about each type of attack. 







            * Mechanisms of Attack
	    
	 * You used a bad password
	    *  * Passwords are hard, and losing your primary email can pretty much stop your life as you attempt to regain control. Luckily, there is a lot you can do to keep yourself from becoming the low hanging fruit. After this section, not only will you be able to protect yourself, but you’ll be able to share this with others.
         * - Read this
            * http://www.passwordanalytics.com/theory/passwords/
            * Read Passwords 101 and submit one example each of the three ways you authenticate yourself.
            * Read Good Passwords 101 and submit a description of what makes a good password
            * Read Strength 101 and submit a description of what makes a strong password
            * Read Pass-Phrase and describe how pass phrases balance being a good password and a strong password.
            * Read Cracking and explain which technique an attacker would use to attack a password that they knew to be 6 random alpha numeric characters
            * Read Cracking and explain which technique an attacker would use to attack a password that they knew to be three random words added together.
         * Why They Matter
            * Here is a brief experiment for you to try. Try to make a rough guess how many web sites you use on a regular basis use your primary email as their account recovery address. Now, try to think about which of those sites are the most important to you that they remain secure; social media, banking, other email accounts. Now think of the sketchy sites you reuse the same password on. If those sites are breached, and the attacker gets your password, they can use it to take your other accounts.
            * - Now, work through the _____ Risk Assessment Steps to determine the level of risk that you assume by reusing your password. 
            * Password Manager
            * All is not lost however, luckily you do not have to memorize hundreds of high entropy passwords or carry them around in a locked diary. Password managers provide the ability to generate and store secure passwords across devices, all controlled by a single master password. This means you only need to know one password, and the rest can be pseudo-randomly generated.

          * Salting
               * - https://thomashunter.name/blog/password-encryption-hashing-salting-explained/
                  * In 2-3 sentences, explain what salting does and why it is important.
               * Combining the ideas of salting and hashing, now learn how you are going to make secure security questions! If we take a hashing algorithm, like MD5, and a unique salt, such as “salty”, we can use the function MD5(_answer_to_question_ + “salty17”). This will create an impossible to guess security question that you can easily use anywhere.
