                    <p> I'm a one man band running this site, and it take a decent amount of time and money to keep going. I made a way for people to do one-time payments through <a href="https://gumroad.com/hoppersroppers">GumRoad</a> to help support me. </p>

                   <p>If you represent a company and want to be affiliated with the best place on the internet to learn security, we are always looking for <a href="sponsors.html">sponsors</a>.

                  <p> If you are looking to <a href="partners.html">partner</a> with us we can work with you to get our site in front of your students, with your people as the instructors so you can teach them and track progress yourselves. We can also do the instructing and send you progress reports.</p>

                <p> However, what we want most of all is that more students learn about this site so that they can take the course and learn the skills they need to succeed. That means the best thing you can do for us is link to us in your blogposts, tweet about us, or share our course to whoever could use it to learn or to teach. </p>
