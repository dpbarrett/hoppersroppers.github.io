Growth is the goal

How do we measure growth?

  Total traffic -> New users -> Active Users
  Measured:
  Week over week
  Month over Month

What is my key value add:

  I care about students
    Does this mean personalized learning plan?????
      Is this what should be paid?

    The unique learning approach we take?

  The Dennis Devey Brand?



Who is my ideal student?
  an absolute beginner who knows nothing and doesn't want to do curriculum dev

Who is my ideal customer
  An expert, or at least informed professional who wants to offload the responsibility of curriculum development
